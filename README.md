# Eat Da Burger!

This app was built using node.js, express.js, mysql, and handlebars.js. On the left of the page a list of available burgers are displayed, with a "devour it" button next to each. If the user clicks the button, the burger moves to the "Devoured Burgers" list on the right of the screen. A text box below enables the user to input his or her own burger, which will then be added to the available burgers list.
